While researching for a forthcoming post about linguistic features of George R. R. Martin's writing in _A Game of Thrones_, I was examining this line (emphasis mine):

>“You will attend me in court this afternoon,” Joffrey said. “See that you bathe and dress as _befits_ my _betrothed_.” (743)

Pretty soon I found myself at the entry "be-, prefix" in the Oxford English Dictionary[^1]. (Those uninterested in language history can skip to the next paragraph now.) It originated in Old English, as a "weak or stressless form of the prep. and adv. _bí_ (big)." The _by-_ in _bylaw, bystander,_ and _bygone_ comes from this same root. "The original meaning was ‘about.’ In prepositions and adverbs this is weakened into a general expression of position at or near, as in _before_ (at, near, or towards the front), _behind, below, beneath, benorth, besouth, between, beyond_." In some cases it "renders an intransitive verb transitive, as in _be-speak_ (speak about, for, or to). Hence it is used to form transitive vbs. on adjectives and substantives, as in _dim be-dim, fool be-fool, madam be-madam_." All of the obscure, obsolete words that occur very seldom fill the rest of the page.

I had intended to simply make a cursory glance at the time periods of some of the entries. Shortly after, however, I realized that instead of just a definition of the prefix and a few examples, it listed out hundreds of words (mostly obsolete—Obs.) containing "be-." Shortly after that, I realized that most of these obsolete words are actually hilarious, and began to read through the entire page, saving my favorites. The highlight reel follows.

## 1. Forming derivative verbs, with sense of ‘around’:

(b.) from side to side (within a space), to and fro, in all directions, in all ways, in or through all its parts, thoroughly, as in bestir v., bejumble.

### befrounce, v. Obs.: to frounce or toss about, touzle.

+ 1581: All her hayre _befrounced_, rent and torne.

### bejig, v.: to jig about.

+ 1821: When they _bejigg'd_ it 'neath the steeple.

### bequirtle, v. Obs.: to besprinkle.
+ 1690: Whole quarts the chamber to _bequirtle_.

### besperple, v. Obs.: to bespatter. 
+ 1529: The grounde..was all _besperpled_ [Winch. besparcled; 1485 bespechled] with blode.

## 2. Forming intensive verbs, with sense of ‘thoroughly (extension of 1), soundly, much, conspicuously, to excess, ridiculously.’ (Some of these occur only in the past participle.)

### bedunch, v. Obs.: to strike against.

+ 1567: Daunce, and _bedunche_ the grounde with fote.

### besnowball, v.:

+ 1611: 'Twere a good deed, to ... _besnowball_ him with rotten egges.

### betwattle, v. Obs. dial.: to bewilder.

+ 1686: They are _betwatled_ in their Understandings.
+ 1844: Poor Bruin thus was sheer _betwattled_.

## 4. Making verbs transitive, by adding a prepositional relation: primarily ‘about,’ as in bespeak v., speak about (or for, to), bemoan v., moan about (or over); which sense can usually be detected under the various against, at, for, to, on, upon, over, by, etc. required by modern idiom:

### becack, v. Obs.: to deposit ordure on.

+ [Ordure, n.: excrement or dung.]
+ 1618: He all my breast _becackes_.

### bechirm, v. Obs.: to chirm (as birds) around.

+ a1250: Hi me _bichirmeþ_ [v.r. bichermet] and bigredeth.

### bescumber, v. Obs.: to scumber on.

+ [Scumber, n.: the dung of a dog or fox.]
+ 1599: This..pedant Mortimers numbers With muck-pit Esculine filth _bescumbers_.
+ 1631: Did Blocke _bescumber_ Statutes white suite?

and its less appropriate cousin,

### beshit, v. (also beshite)  [Old English bescítan] = becack vb.

+ (Obs. in polite use, but common in Middle English and early modern English literature).
+ a1683: Flies which would the Deity _beshite_.
+ 1727: I have been frighted, pumped, kicked..and _beshitten_.

## 5. Forming trans. verbs on adjectives and substantives, taken as complements of the predicate, meaning To make.

(c.) To call, to style, to dub with the title of, etc. Often with a depreciatory or contemptuous force.

### be-blockhead, v.:

+ 1768: He so _be-blockheaded_ and be-blunderbust me about as was enough to hurry anybody and throw them off their guard.

## (6.) Forming trans. verbs on substantives used in an instrumental relation; the primary idea being;

(a.) To surround, cover, or bedaub with, as in _becloud_ v., to put clouds about, cover with clouds, _bedew_ v.;

### becoom, v.: to smear with coom.

+ [Coom, n.: Soot, esp. that which forms about a fireplace, or settles as smuts from a smoky atmosphere. (Get your mind out of the gutter.)]
+ 1882: A ship's fireman all _becoomed_ and besmoked.

### bewimple, v. Obs.:

+ 1393: Where lay _be~wimpled_ a visage.

(b.) To affect with in any way, as in benight v., beguile n., befriend v.; In both sets there is often an accompanying notion of ‘thoroughly, excessively,’ as in 2.

### befrumple, v. Obs.: to crease into frumples or clumsy folds.

+ 1611: To hang forth loose, to sit bagging, flagging, or _befrumpled_, as an ouer-wide garment.

### bemissionary, v.: to pester with missionaries.

+ 1884: Till the end of his days he is _bemissionaried_ by the society which has made him what he is.

### beslipper, v.: to present with slippers.

+ 1866: Poor men!..to be be-teapotted and _be-slippered_.

## 8. Examples of the capabilities of be- are seen in ...

### to be-Mary: to give us too much of ‘Mary,’

+ 1812   G. Colman Poet. Vagaries 82   The world has been much _be-Mary'd_, of late..we have innumerable sweet little Stanzas..ending with ‘my Mary.’

Also, these _be-_ verbs tend to come in flocks, and appear to have a more humorous tone, as indicated by these (and many of the previous) examples:

+ 1602: He that minds trishtrash..Him will I _be-lish-lash_.
+ 1863: Only a ‘small sin,’ a smug, _be-furred, be-combed, be-scented, be-ribboned, be-lady-loved_ ‘little fox!’

And finally, even the grammar Nazis can get a kick out of a brief bout of beprefixed banter:

### beparse, v.: to plague with parsing.

+ 1880: Grammar that has so weighed down our poor _beparsed_ English-speaking people.

### becomma, v.: to sprinkle with commas.

+ 1881: The senseless _‘be~commaing’_ of many Shakespere texts.
