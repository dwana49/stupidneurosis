"Y repetía el poeta: 'Creo que siempre es preferible la neurosis a la imbecilidad.'"

This line comes from the short story *El pájaro azul*, the Blue Bird, first published in the book *Azul* in 1888. The author is Rubén Darío, a Nicaraguan poet who started a literary movement that I don't really remember the significance of. However, I do remember this story, which I came across while trying desperately to come up with a topic for my final paper.

Here's [the full text](http://www.damisela.com/literatura/pais/nicaragua/autores/dario/azul/pajaro_p3.htm) if you know Spanish and want to soak it in, otherwise tl;dr —

>Setting: cross between the cast of Rent and the students from Les Mis.

>One of the bohemians writes poetry and drinks a lot of absinthe. He keeps going on about how his brain is the cage of a blue bird that wants to fly into the blue sky. He would always repeat,

>"I believe that neurosis is always preferable to stupidity/idiocy."
>
>There's a bit of character development: paternal disappointment, 20-something angst, and so on. At the end of the story, they find him sprawled across his bed with his brains blown out onto the pillow. The blue bird has been freed!

I'll always remember the inital shock from the ending, but that wasn't the main part I took away from this work.

###When I was in college
(just a few short months ago at the time of writing), I sometimes had a feeling that I'd developed some slight neuroses as a result of all the classes and other commitments I had gotten myself into. When I contemplated the alternative though, not taking part in things and probably watching Netflix all day, I realized that I would never feel my most fulfilled as a person.

It occurred to me that I need my neurosis to keep my stupidity at bay.

So I've taken up the poet's neurosis as my rallying cry and the uncaged blue bird as my emblem. Therein lies the meaning behind the blue bird bursting out the back of a head you see at the top of the page, in case you were curious. I'm always going to stay off the paths leading to flatness and tedium.

Stay neurotic, my friends
