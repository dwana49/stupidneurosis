The other night in a bout of post-graduation "now what," I popped open Netflix and started watching The CW's show [_Arrow_](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/arrow). On the air since 2012, it takes elements from DC comic book hero Green Arrow. Five-line summary:

>After a shipwreck kills his father, rich kid Oliver Queen spends five mysterious years (which we learn of through flashbacks) on a deserted island. Upon returning he becomes a vigilante and, with the help of his lawyer (ex[?]-) girlfriend, starts taking down corrupt businessmen in his father's memory.

Instead of going after people with _alter egos,_ Oliver pursures [mono-ego-ed] rich people who are hiding career-killing criminal master plans. Examples include:

+ the housing mogul who put defective smoke detectors in low-income housing, resulting in many deaths by fire, and
+ the industrial bigshot who dumped out toxic waste, had a whistleblower "disposed of," and framed the whistleblower's husband for her murder.

"Typical" supervillains tend to use their superpower/suit to seek a more generic shade of power or control. These villains are in stark contrast to those conquered in _Arrow_. This is an important distinction to make at the creative level, as I will discuss later.

Overall it's an excellent show, with lots of plot twists, subterfuge, and "OH MY GOD WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN NEXT?!?!". The fight scenes are well-choreographed, the character relationships well-written, and our hero well-stubbled.

Ok now that we've got that out of the way, let's proceed.

# The JLA goes Greek

Many have already written about the similarities between _superheroes_ and _heroes of classical mythology._ In a 2008 Vanity Fair interview[^1] with several prominent figures in the superhero field, Guillermo del Toro says [emphasis mine],

>There is still _a longing for mythos_, for a spiritual Pantheon. [...] the only sort of acceptable mythology, I think, is superhero mythology.

When you look at Superman's story, it starts to resemble Perseus's. The same goes for Spiderman and Odysseus, Batman and Hercules. Check out this guy's crazy awesome masters thesis[^2] if you don't believe me (and if you have some time to spare).

Harvard classics professor Gregory Nagy adds that although the heroic feats of old weren't meant to be believed to the letter [emphasis mine],

>[...] myths about heroes were accepted as _valid narratives_ about moral truths that _helped explain life_.

In other words, the tales of both super- and classical heroes echo a culture's preferred ways (at a cultural level) to deal with challenges.

The interesting part happens when we look what these stories say about the cultures that created them. More importantly, we need to look at how those implications change _over time_.

# Like a broken arrow

Last semester I took an anthropology class called Language in Society and Culture. We spent one class period reading _proverbs and creation myths_ of several African cultures. From those myths, we _inferred what sorts of values_ had high importance within the culture. One of the stories we read was the Wahungwe creation myth[^3]. In it, the first man had intercourse with the second woman for several nights. (The first woman was responsible for plant life.) Each morning she would give birth to more animals and humans.

The next day, the god Maori announced his displeasure at the rampant procreation, but the woman told the man to _build a door_ to their house so Maori could not see what they were doing. They went about their business, but the next day, she gave birth to all the _violent animals_: snakes, lions, scorpions, etc. Our group inferred that because having sex in private resulted in the creation of the violent animals, this culture must not have instilled values of _shame and taboo toward sex_ like we do in Western culture.

Another African culture brings us this proverb, which will stick in my head for a long time:

>A barren woman is like a leaking pot.

If this culture is equating

+ a woman past childbearing age with
+ a once useful item that no longer works,

it's not a stretch to infer that women's primary—maybe even _only_—redeeming function in their eyes is childbearing.

This was one of my favorite days in class and I couldn't stop thinking about how what we say, do, read, and write _reflects our own culture_.

Which brings us back to _Arrow_...

#BOOP

Right away in the pilot, Oliver Queen targets Adam Hunt, a wealthy financier who has been _swindling_ people out of their homes and money for years to line his own pockets. Laurel Lance, one of Starling City's top lawyers (who also happens to be Ollie's ex-girlfriend), is prosecuting the case. As usually happens with these sort of people, Hunt has an _army of lawyers_ and other nasty people who will stop at nothing to cover his tracks. This same basic archetypal villain recurs throughout the episodes (which I have only seen five of at the time of writing this, but I'd call that enough to declare a pattern).

Compare this villain with Lex Luthor in the original Superman film from 1978 (really, whenever Luthor appears). He is also an extremely wealthy man, but one whose strength is augmented _not with manpower but with inventions._ His one archnemesis is Superman, and he executes grandiose plans for the main purpose of Superman's downfall. Again, [Guillermo del Toro:](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/07/why-america-worships-superheroes)

> “When you look back at the time Superman was born, it was portraying, quite essentially, _the ethos of the time_,” del Toro adds. “When you see the recombinant DNA of the superheroes when they were reinvented in the highly dubious 80s, by Alan Moore and Frank Miller, they are virulent testaments to the _neo-fascism and consumerism_ of a sheepish society.”

The point I'm trying to make here is that the villains from earlier superhero stories are _quite overtly and canonically villainous_ and make it their mission to stop the superheroes from interfering with their plots. On the other hand, the villains that crop up in Arrow are more reminiscent of infamous real-world high-profile figures in the financial and political sectors _that might well be straight out of a 21st-century newspaper headline._

# BOP

When we look at the historical context of these villains over time, we can start to see how _the entertainment industry mirrors the zeitgeist_ of that particular time period. 1978's Lex Luthor was menacing America with two highly destructive missiles, and Superman had to stop him. This could have been _a representation of the Cold War-era arms race in film._ Superman represents America; Luthor, the USSR. The movie can be seen as _a response to Cold War tensions_ in the form of a super-powered daydream echoing real-world current events. (Of course, nuclear war isn't exactly something we've really _stopped_ worrying about, and as such, it hasn't yet left our cultural vocabulary.)

But _in 2014's world_ of NSA spying, "the 1%," net neutrality, and corporations pushing their a$$et$ around in the political arena, present-day America has a new set of problems to worry about, problems _closer to home._ As Americans become more socially conscious, we are raising our voice about these new injustices.

And the entertainment industry is doing what it does best: capitalizing on the public's sentiments.

It should come as no surprise that the mythical hero Oliver Queen is facing off against _corrupt businessmen_ and _one-percenters_ in "Arrow" instead of the expectable, conspicuously power-hungry, super-suited _supervillains_ of older superhero movies. A modern American audience will rally more strongly against a _fraudulent drug-dealing CEO_ than against a _criminally insane cyborg_.

As the days go by, more and more Americans are [let down by the justice system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin), [let down by legislators](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/six-studies-that-show-everything-republicans-believe-is-wrong-20140423), and [let down by corporations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAcaeLmybCY).

------

The more downtrodden we become, the more we turn to shows like "Arrow" and heroes like Oliver, through whom we **fantasize about beating up these transgressors** and submit them to **receive justice under the law**. "Arrow" is being renewed for a third season precisely because it shows us people who might be _the very people who are making our lives crappy_ at work or at home, and watch them get _punched in the face_ by the incarnation of self-empowerment and then _pay accordingly_ for the crimes they've committed.

#In summary

We've looked at:

+ how myths reflect the cultural values of a society;
+ how those values change over time;
+ how superhero stories are the modern version of mythology, a tale meant not to be believed in full but rather to represent our cultural values; and
+ how superheroes assailing stockbrokers is a reflection of the new problems that modern Americans are struggling with.

I hope you've enjoyed my rabbit-holey exploration of this topic. I'd love to hear your thoughts on my piece, and also this one: I'm thinking of doing a similar analysis of House of Cards, what with all the political subtext going on there. If you're still reading this, thank you!
