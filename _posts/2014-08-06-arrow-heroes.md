The other night in a bout of post-graduation "now what," I popped open Netflix and started watching The CW's show ["Arrow"](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/arrow). On the air since 2012, it's based loosely on the DC comic book hero Green Arrow. Five-line summary:

After his dad dies in a shipwreck, rich kid Oliver Queen spends five mysterious years on a deserted island (which are explained gradually via flashback). Upon returning he becomes a vigilante and, with the help of his lawyer (ex[?]-) girlfriend, starts taking down corrupt businessmen in his father's memory.

All the villains Oliver goes after are people who <em>don't have alter egos,</em> they're more rich people who are hiding some very bad things. Examples include:

+ the housing mogul who put defective smoke detectors in low-income housing, resulting in many deaths by fire, and
+ the industrial bigshot who dumped out toxic waste, had a whistleblower "disposed of," and framed the whistleblower's husband for her murder.

<p>Arrow's antagonists are in <em>notable contrast to the typical super-villain</em>, who is out for a very generic sort of power/control and usually has some form of super power at his disposal. This is an important distinction to make at the creative level, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Overall it's a <em>very</em> good show, with lots of plot twists, subterfuge, and "OH MY GOD WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN NEXT?!?!". The fight scenes are well-choreographed, the character relationships well-written, and our hero well-stubbled.</p>

<p>Ok now that we've got that out of the way, let's proceed.</p>

<p>Much has already been written concerning the <em>similarities of superheros to heroes of classical mythology</em>. In a 2008&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/07/why-america-worships-superheroes" title="Why America Worships Superheroes | Vanity Fair">Vanity Fair article</a>&nbsp;with quotes from several prominent figures in the field,&nbsp;Guillermo del Toro says [emphasis mine],</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is still <em>a longing for mythos</em>, for a spiritual Pantheon. [...]&nbsp;the only sort of acceptable mythology, I think, is superhero mythology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also check out <a href="http://dspace.uttyler.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10950/73/Latham_Andrew.pdf?sequence=1" title="Comic Books vs. Greek Mythology: the Ultimate Crossover for the Classical Scholar" target="_blank">this guy's crazy awesome masters thesis</a>&nbsp;comparing Superman to Perseus, Spiderman to Odysseus, and Batman to Hercules if you want a more long-form reading.</p>
<p>Harvard classics professor Gregory Nagy adds that although the heroic feats of old weren't meant to be believed to the letter [emphasis mine],</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>myths about heroes were accepted as <em>valid narratives</em> about moral truths that <em>helped explain life</em>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span> In other words, the tales of both super- and classical heroes are responses to how we feel <em>at a cultural level</em> we&nbsp;ought to deal with challenges.</span></p>

<p><span>The interesting part happens when we look what these stories say about the cultures that created them, and more importantly, how those implications change <em>over time</em>.</span></p>

<p>In an anthropology class (Language in Society and Culture) that I took last semester, we spent a day reading <em>proverbs and creation myths</em> of several African cultures, and then from those myths, <em>inferring what sorts of values</em> had high importance within the culture. According to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=wahungwe+creation+myth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4XKwTnhXfW&amp;sig=nm7hf5Sk1XYkyuOtFQbo_cD2_Rw&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DM56U5SrA4yKyAS-iYGgBA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wahungwe%20creation%20myth&amp;f=false" title="Wahungwe | Creation Myths of the World" target="_blank">the Wahungwe creation myth</a>, the first man had intercourse with the second woman for several nights, and each morning she would give birth to more animals and humans. (The first woman was responsible for plant life.)</p>
<p>The next day, the god Maori announced his displeasure at the rampant procreation, but the woman told the man to <em>build a door</em> to their house so Maori could not see what they were doing. They went about their business, but the next day, she gave birth to all the <em>violent animals</em>: snakes, lions, scorpions, etc.&nbsp;Our group inferred that because having sex in private resulted in the creation of the violent animals, this culture must not have instilled values of<em> shame and taboo toward sex</em> like we do in the Western world.</p>

<p>And here's the proverb I remember most vividly of those we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A barren woman is like a leaking pot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we can infer that whatever culture used this proverb placed high value on the <em>childbearing</em> function of women and not much else, very much at odds with modern <em>feminist</em> thought.</p>
<p>This was one of my favorite days in class and I couldn't stop thinking about how&nbsp;what we say, do, read, and write <em>reflects our own culture</em>.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Arrow...</p>

<p>Right away in the pilot, Oliver Queen targets Adam Hunt, a wealthy financier who has been <em>swindling</em> people out of their homes and money for years to line his own pockets. Laurel Lance, one of Starling City's top lawyers (who also happens to be Ollie's ex-girlfriend), is prosecuting the case. As usually happens with these sort of people, Hunt has an <em>army of lawyers</em> and other nasty people who will stop at nothing to cover his tracks. This same basic archetype of villain recurs throughout the episodes (which I have only seen five of at the time of writing this, but I'd call that enough to declare a pattern).</p>

<p>Compare this villain with Lex Luthor in the original Superman film from 1978 (really, whenever Luthor appears). He is also an extremely wealthy man, but one whose strength is augmented <em>not with manpower but with inventions.</em> His one archnemesis is Superman, and he executes grandiose plans for the main purpose of Superman's downfall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here is that the villains from less recent superhero stories are <em>quite plainly and canonically villainous</em> and make it their mission to stop the superheroes from interfering with their plots. On the other hand, the villains that crop up in Arrow are more reminiscent of infamous real-world high-profile figures in the financial and political sectors&nbsp;<em>that</em> <em>might well be straight out of a 21st-century newspaper headline</em>.</p>

<p>When we look at the historical context of these villains over time, we can start to see how the <em>entertainment industry mirrors the zeitgeist</em> of that particular time period. 1978's Lex Luthor was menacing America with two highly destructive missiles, and Superman had to stop him. This could have been <em>a representation of the Cold War-era arms race in film</em>. Superman represents America; Luthor, the USSR. The movie can be seen as <em>a response to Cold War tensions</em> in the form of a super-powered daydream echoing real-world current events. (Of course, nuclear war isn't exactly something we've really <em>stopped</em> worrying about, and as such, it hasn't yet left our cultural vocabulary.)</p>

<p>But <em>in 2014's world</em> of NSA spying, "the 1%," net neutrality, and corporations pushing their a$$et$ around in the political arena, present-day America has a new set of problems to worry about, problems&nbsp;<em>closer to home</em>. As Americans become more socially conscious, we are raising our voice about these new injustices.</p>
<p>And the entertainment industry is doing what it does best: capitalizing on those opinions.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that the mythical hero Oliver Queen is facing off against <em>corrupt businessmen </em>and<em> one-percenters</em>&nbsp;in "Arrow" instead of the expectable, conspicuously power-hungry, super-suited <em>supervillains</em> of older superhero movies. A modern American audience will rally more strongly against a <em>fraudulent drug-dealing CEO</em> than against a&nbsp;<em>criminally insane cyborg</em>.</p>

<p>The more downtrodden we become, the more we turn to shows like "Arrow" and heroes like Oliver, through whom we&nbsp;<strong>fantasize about beating up these transgressors</strong>&nbsp;and submit them to&nbsp;<strong>receive justice under the law</strong><em>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>"Arrow" is being renewed for a third season precisely because it shows us people who might be&nbsp;<em>the very people who are making our lives crappy</em> at work or at home, and watch them get <em>punched in the face</em> by the incarnation of self-empowerment and then <em>pay accordingly</em>&nbsp;for the crimes they've committed.</p>

<p>In summary, we've looked at how myths reflect the cultural values of a society, and that those values change over time; how superhero stories are the modern version of mythology, a tale meant not to be believed in full but rather to represent our cultural values; and how superheroes assailing stockbrokers is a reflection of the new problems that modern Americans are struggling with.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed my rabbit-holey exploration of this topic. I'd love to hear your thoughts on my piece, and also this one: I'm thinking of doing a similar analysis of House of Cards, what with all the political subtext going on there. If you're still reading this, thank you!</p>
