Riverrun sat _athwart_ the Lannister supply lines (793)

He had taken off Father’s face, Bran thought, and _donned_ the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. (14)

_Over their heads flapped the banner_ of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field. (14)

Ned _broke his fast_ with his daughters and Septa Mordane. (523)

Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and _ahorse_, wearing his battered halfhelm. (682)

“You will attend me in court this afternoon,” Joffrey said. “See that you bathe and dress as _befits_ my _betrothed_.” (743)

Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt _owed the Starks_. (324)

He needed help to mount; he felt as though he weighed _a thousand stone_. (683)

Ned was not _near as confident_ of Robert as he pretended, but there was no reason Cersei _need know_ that. (481)

Damn her, he thought, why _is_ the woman not _fled_? I have given her chance after chance … (523)
