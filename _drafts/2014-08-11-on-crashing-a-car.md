# June, 2008.

### A few days after my sixteenth birthday. An empty parking lot at a park in my hometown. A white 2000 Subaru Outback station wagon, all-wheel drive, stickshift.

My dad and I were on the way home from the DMV, where I had just registered for my temps. We had waited until the end of my junior year before enrolling in driver's ed, even though I was eligible the previous December. (My parents are both teachers, so they would have more time to deal with the process during the summer.) Once you factored in my skipping a grade in elementary school, this meant all my friends had already been driving for over a year.

If you've ever been a high schooler in America, you know the peer pressure surrounding the driver's license, and the social status it commands. It means you can drive yourself to after-school activities instead of relying on friends to pick you up. It means you can go to the mall with friends without your mom as your chaperone and chauffeur. (So I've heard, anyway; I was never one for shopping. Or going places with lots of friends.)

Even though I was about to pass through the most important gateway in a high schooler's life, I was hesitant when my dad took a different route home than usual and stopped at the park. I knew what was going to happen and I was on edge, although maybe it was for good reason:

1. The first car I was expected to drive was stickshift.
2. Large rocks surrounded the narrow parking lot my dad had chosen, to prevent cars from driving on the soccer fields.
3. My left arm and hand were in a splint as a result of a misadventure on my sister's Ripstik the previous week.

That last point had me particularly worried. Wheels and I had already disagreed once that summer, and I would've preferred not to add to my list of accidents. I thought my dad must have been crazy for giving me my inaugural driver’s seat under those circumstances.

But still I trusted him, and that summer set about learning the complex interrelationships of the clutch and the stick, the tires and the pedals, my eyes and my hands, the mirrors and the road. I stalled out a lot, especially when a light turned green, but I gradually learned how to operate that machine. I managed to do so without seriously injuring myself, anyone else, or the car, and for that I like to give myself a pat on the back occasionally. As I like to say, over the course of learning to drive I hit 100% fewer mailboxes than my little sister. (I know, I know, you were backing out of a curvy driveway and you couldn’t see it, or whatever, but still.)

As I began to drive more and more in my last year of high school and when I was home from college (I live within walking distance from everything at school), I began to marvel at the how well the system of our roads works. Sure we hear about car crashes and deaths and all, but for every one collision, think about all the thousands of cars in every city that go about their business every single day entirely without incident. The flow of traffic down roads evokes an image of water rushing down an invisible trough, every drop following along in its place. Driving at 70 miles an hour two feet from another hunk of steel hurtling down a concrete path at the same speed, and trusting that it’s a normal thing and that the chance of the two of them crashing is infinitesimal, gives me a sense of awe.

In my hometown the big new thing in road construction is roundabouts. Known to some as traffic circles, these rotary intersections replaced four major intersections in a bustling commercial district near the highway. Over winter break right after the roundabouts were opened, I would ride with my mom to her school in the mornings and then take her car for the day. On my way home, I would hit up McDonald’s right next to the big three-lane roundabout, buy two apple pies for a dollar, and park as close as I could to watch all the drivers try to figure out what the hell was going on during morning rush hour. In the initial weeks, several local police cars circled the four roundabouts continuously during rush hour, pulling over four or five cars over a period of a half hour. I bore witness to typically three near-collisions daily caused by people going out of turn.

While I enjoyed my newfound spectator sport, I also appreciated the beauty and harmony of this system, like a water wheel turning ceaselessly, depositing each drop where it needed to go. Sometimes I would be driving and realize how easily I could send my car off the road into a ditch with a jerk of my hand, yet some invisible force keeps us all on the same path. I guessed at how fast I would need to go to break through the barrier on a bridge and fall into the river, wondered if the barrier would be strong enough to keep my car on the bridge, analyzed the physics of it all to the best of my ability. Running under it all was that invisible force, keeping my little white droplet coursing through its trough, contained within the walls of its figurative canal and out of the literal canal thirty feet below.

# December 25, 2013.

### Around 6:15 p.m., snowy conditions. Highway 29, fifteen minutes outside of Thorp, Wisconsin. Same white Subaru station wagon.

I was driving alone from my hometown to my college town and then to Minneapolis, where my choir was meeting to leave the next day on an international tour. I had been driving all day without much incident, but as I got within 45 minutes of my university, I entered a patch of snow. I was driving what would have been a reasonable to too-slow speed in good conditions, meaning I was going too fast for the snow. I felt the back of the car start to fishtail to the right and I hit the brakes. I tried to keep the car pointing forward, but now it was sliding left, and then right again. All I thought was, “I’m going to get to my friend’s house so late now.” As the car spun almost perpendicular across the lanes (luckily there were no cars around me), the momentum tipped it over onto its side and finally its roof. It fell into the ditch between the east- and westbound lanes, which was covered snow up to my waist, and I’m a pretty tall guy. If not for that snow covering, I probably would have injured myself or even died. Of course, if not for that snow I never would have crashed in the first place, but small miracles.

I dangled in the driver’s seat with my seatbelt suspending me above the steering wheel. I don’t remember hitting my head on anything, and I didn’t see any airbags. (The whole crash was actually pretty gentle, almost like an amusement park ride that got stuck midway through one of the vertical loops. If that crash were a real ride, I’d go on it.) The engine was still running somehow, upside-down, so I reached… down and turned off the engine. I was also lucky in that none of the windows shattered, so I had no broken class to worry about.

The way the car had landed, all of the windows were blocked in by snow except the trunk, where I saw flashlights and heard voices. I crawled up the ceiling of the car, ducking under the seats, until I got to the window and made contact with the people who stopped. The doors were locked, so I crawled back down, gathered my coat and things that I immediately needed, and hit the unlock button. I told them I was uninjured and the sole occupant of the vehicle.

Police cars and tow trucks came to assess the situation and drag the car out, and I called a friend to come pick me up. Nothing else
